# stardew-spring-harvest
Recursively finds the optimal harvest schedule for spring crops in stardew valley by finding all permutations

# The Data...
These profits are assuming that your only source of income is your farming harvests. This
assumption, however does not change the profitability of crops on spring year 1, assuming an optimal 
planting time (shown on page 2), the ratio of profitability of a potato-only harvest compared to the others 
will remain the same. You can view page XXXX to see a test farm where you're bringing in 500$ a day 
from other sources, and how that affects your farming profits.

This data is assuming no starred harvests, and average luck 
(25% for an extra potato, 2% for an extra strawberry).

### OPTIMAL
The optimal farm is potatoes only (see page 2 for the planting and harvest calendar + daily valuation)

### STRAWBERRIES
Purchasing strawberries on day 13 and planting them for 2 harvests (assuming no speed-gro) is less 
profitable than a potato-only harvest. Planting these seeds and harvesting them to put into a seed mixer 
before year 2 might be your bets bet for profitability (assuming that you cant find a better investment for a 
small starberry harvest before then).
See page XX for a speed-gro analysis (since its possible at level 3 farming)

### CAULIFLOWER
Sorry cauliflower fans, but on a cauliflower-only harvesting schedule, you simply can't grow your farm
exponentially like potatoes can. *See page XXXX for a farm assuming 500$ daily profits from other sources*

### SHOULD YOU SELL YOUR PARSNIP SEEDS?
Short answer, no. For profits only, you'd be losing out on 6000. You're also losing out on getting 
farming level 1 by day 4 so that you can protect your crops from crows. The only benefit here is that 
your harvest cycles become easier... that is if you dont make any money elsewhere..."
